## Description

> AWS Lambda dev tool for Serverless. Allows Express synthax in handlers. Supports packaging, local invoking and offline Application Load Balancer and API Gateway lambda server mocking.

- Plug & Play (easy to install, configure and use)
- Highly customizable
- Functions are bundled by [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild)
- Offline server uses NodeJS `http` module
- Packaging is made by [node-archiver](https://github.com/archiverjs/node-archiver)

# Installation

```bash
yarn add -D serverless-aws-lambda
# or
npm install -D serverless-aws-lambda
```

```yaml
service: myapp

frameworkVersion: "3"
configValidationMode: error

plugins:
  - serverless-aws-lambda
```

---

### Usage

Start the offline server

```bash
SLS_DEBUG="*" sls aws-lambda -s dev
```

It is also possible to passe port from the CLI with `--port` or `-p`.

This will overwrite serverless.yml custom > serverless-aws-lambda values if they are set.

### Invoke

Offline server supports Application Load Balancer and API Gateway endponts.  
Appropriate `event` object is sent to the handler based on your lambda declaration.

```yaml
functions:
  myAwsomeLambda:
    handler: src/handlers/awsomeLambda.default
    events:
      - alb:
          listenerArn: arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:eu-west-3:170838072631:listener/app/myAlb/bf88e6ec8f3d91df/e653b73728d04626
          priority: 939
          conditions:
            path: "/paradise"
            method: GET
```

`myAwsomeLambda` is available at `http://localhost:PORT/paradise`

However if your declare both `alb` and `http` or `httpApi` inside a single lambda `events` with the same `path` you have to specify desired server by setting `alb` or `apg` inside your request's:

- header with `X-Mock-Type`.
- or in query string with `x_mock_type`.

Please note that invoking a lambda from sls CLI (`sls invoke local -f myFunction`) will not trigger the offline server. But you are still able to inject any event with `-d 'someData'` sls CLI option.

You can also invoke your Lambdas with a custom `event` object by making a POST request to:  
http://localhost:3000/@invoke/myAwsomeLambda  
for `aws-sdk` Lambda client compatibility it is also possible to request to:  
http://localhost:3000/2015-03-31/functions/myAwsomeLambda/invocations

Example with with `aws-sdk` Lambda Client:

```js
const { LambdaClient, InvokeCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-lambda");

const client = new LambdaClient({ region: "PARADISE", endpoint: "http://localhost:3000" });
const DryRun = "DryRun";
const Event = "Event";
const RequestResponse = "RequestResponse";

const cmd = new InvokeCommand({
  FunctionName: "myAwsomeLambda",
  InvocationType: RequestResponse,
  Payload: Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({ foo: "bar" })),
});

client
  .send(cmd)
  .then((data) => {
    data.Payload = new TextDecoder("utf-8").decode(data.Payload);
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // ðŸ¥²
    console.log("error", error);
  });
```

### Environment variable

Lambdas are executed in worker threads. Only variables declared in your `serverless.yml` are injected into `process.env` except `IS_LOCAL`, `LOCAL_PORT` and `NODE_ENV`

---

## Advanced configuration:

To have more control over the plugin you can passe a config file via `configPath` param in plugin options:

```yaml
custom:
  serverless-aws-lambda:
    port: 3000
    configPath: ./config.default
```

See [defineConfig](resources/defineConfig.md) for advanced configuration.

---

### Use [Express](https://expressjs.com) syntax with your lambdas:

[See docs.](resources/express.md)
